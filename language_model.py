#Entered query is split and words within the sentence undergo permutations to from various sentences.
#pwords2->bigram model(probability of a two words occuring together)
#cPword->calculates conditional probability.
#load_counts->dictionary of all the bigrams of the sentence.
#product->gives the probability of the entire sentence by multiplying the conditional probabilities of the bigram obtained from load_counts.
#pwords2 uses cPword and the product function to calculate the probability of two word occuring together given that the previous word has occured.
